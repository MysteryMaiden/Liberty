Section 1.

I used <a> rather than <button> because it is better practice to use <a> in
            navbars for acessibility and styling, but to prove that I do know how to use <button>
            propporly, here is what my code would look like if I used <button> instead:

            <button onclick="document.location = ‘index.html’">Home</button>
            <button onclick="document.location = ‘cover.html’">Cover</button>
            <button onclick="document.location = ‘resume.html’">Resume</button>
            <button onclick="document.location = ‘hobby.html’">Hobby</button>
            <button onclick="document.location = ‘contact.html’">Contact</button>
            <hr>
