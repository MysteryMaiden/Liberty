                    <h3>Experience summary</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have developed a wide range of personal and
                        collaborative projects that demonstrate strong technical
                        ability, creativity, and self-direction. Most of my work
                        involves building websites, tools, and interactive
                        experiences, including fully functional login systems,
                        browser-based inbox interfaces, quiz-style personality
                        tests based on original stories, and a fan site with
                        dynamically organized content. One of my most extensive
                        projects is a ServiceNow-integrated fantasy name
                        generator that expands into a full Dungeons & Dragons
                        character creator, complete with species, class, stat
                        rolls, and modular rerolling logic. I also built the
                        Academic Resource Library for the National Honor
                        Society—my most substantial real-world project—where I
                        worked with a team to design pages, curate academic
                        materials, and develop organized systems for student
                        use.
                        <br /><br />
                        My skills include strong proficiency in HTML, CSS,
                        JavaScript, and JSON, with additional experience in
                        Python, GitHub version control, ServiceNow workflows,
                        and UI building. I am highly comfortable with tools like
                        VS Code, Zed, Photoshop, Canva, and various cloud and
                        document platforms. I regularly troubleshoot technical
                        issues through research, experimentation, and structured
                        problem-solving, and I'm accustomed to teaching myself
                        new software, creative techniques, and coding concepts
                        through hands-on work.
                        <br /><br />
                        Beyond web development, I’ve built and maintained
                        long-term creative projects, including multiple book
                        series, an animated YouTube show in production, and
                        several independent passion projects that require
                        planning, scripting, coordination, and iterative
                        development. I have leadership experience through school
                        programs such as Student Body Officers and the National
                        Honor Society, where I managed events, led tutoring
                        initiatives, and guided team-based projects like the
                        Academic Resource Library.
                        <br /><br />
                        Looking forward, I aim to transition into artificial
                        intelligence and neurotechnology as an entrepreneur. I’m
                        driven by curiosity, innovation, and a desire to build
                        technologies that meaningfully improve people’s lives.
                        My independent learning, project management, and
                        technical foundation have prepared me to contribute to
                        forward-thinking teams—and ultimately to develop
                        groundbreaking solutions of my own.

                <div class="card section-card">
                    <h3>Perceived Calling</h3>
                    <p>
                        I believe God is calling me to use my gifts in
                        neurotechnology and artificial intelligence to help
                        people and improve lives. I feel drawn to innovation not
                        for the sake of success alone, but because these tools
                        have the potential to ease suffering, restore abilities,
                        and create opportunities for millions. I do hope to
                        become successful in business, but I’m also mindful of
                        the biblical reminder that we cannot serve both God and
                        money. Because of that, I see success not as an end
                        goal, but as a responsibility, a way to steward
                        resources wisely, support others, and use whatever
                        influence I gain to honor God and care for His people.
